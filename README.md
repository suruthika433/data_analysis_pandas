README â€“ Task 5: Data Analysis on CSV Files

Loaded sales dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.

Explored data using head(), info(), describe(), and checked for missing values.

Used groupby() to aggregate total sales by product category, gender, and month.

Created new month column from the date field for time-based analysis.

Visualized results using Matplotlib:
